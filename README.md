Practice

This repository contains my hands-on practice work in:
- Python programming
- Data analysis using Pandas and NumPy
- Basic data visualization
- Introductory bioinformatics-related scripts

Purpose
To build a strong foundation in data science and bioinformatics through regular practice and small exercises.

Content
- Python basics (loops, functions, data structures)
- Pandas operations (data cleaning, filtering, aggregation)
- Simple exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Beginner bioinformatics examples (FASTA handling, basic sequence stats)

This repository will be updated continuously as I learn and practice.
